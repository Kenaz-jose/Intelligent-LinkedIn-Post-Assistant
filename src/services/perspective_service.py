- MISSING_METRIC: Use when a claim needs hard numbers, thresholds, or benchmarks (e.g., F1-scores, latency).
- MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION: Use when the answer lacks the specific architecture, library, or engineering decision used.
- MISSING_MECHANISM: Use when they state a concept but fail to explain the underlying logic of *how* or *why* it works.
- MISSING_ANECDOTE: Use when they describe a struggle broadly but omit the specific error message, moment, or real-world friction.
- MISSING_STAKE: Use when they explain a decision but fail to mention the risk, tradeoff, or what would have broken.
- MISSING_TACTIC: Use when they mention a broad strategy or workflow, but fail to provide the exact, actionable steps.

    treats "no probe needed" and "probe complete" identically, so an
    empty result is a normal outcome rather than an error.
